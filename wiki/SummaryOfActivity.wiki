*July 25th, 2012*

Added new rule that validates if the name of a Class, Method, Field, contains the name of its type, hence a class called `MyClass` would raise a violation.

*July 26th, 2012*

Added a new rule that validates if constant, field or variable, are spelled with the `PascalCase` naming convention.

*July 27th, 2012*

Bug fix in the `NameHasNonEnglishCharacter` rule where strongly types class, would violate the rule because of the `<T>` suffix.

Optimizations to the `ClassContainsTooManyLine`, `MethodContainsTooManyLine` and `PropertyContainsTooManyLine` rules.

Revised the resource test rules to correctly have the right amount of lines in Class, Method and Property to match the rule correctly, as the rule optimization listed above included a fix where the number of lines reported was off by one.

Update the Trunk to match [http://stylecop.codeplex.com/ StyleCop] v4.7.35.0
