*July 25th, 2012*

Added new rule that validates if the name of a Class, Method, Field, contains the name of its type, hence a class called `MyClass` would raise a violation.

*July 26th, 2012*

Added a new rule that validates if constant, field or variable, are spelled with the `PascalCase` naming convention.

*July 27th, 2012*

Bug fix in the `NameHasNonEnglishCharacter` rule where strongly types class, would violate the rule because of the `<T>` suffix.

Optimizations to the `ClassContainsTooManyLine`, `MethodContainsTooManyLine` and `PropertyContainsTooManyLine` rules.

Revised the resource test rules to correctly have the right amount of lines in Class, Method and Property to match the rule correctly, as the rule optimization listed above included a fix where the number of lines reported was off by one.

Update the Trunk to match [http://stylecop.codeplex.com/ StyleCop] v4.7.35.0

*July 28th, 2012*

Modified the rule `VariableNameIsTooShort`. Before the change, the rule would simply validate the list of variables contained inside a method. Effectively, it was allowing the use of a variable too short when defined in a `for` statement. Now, the variable initialized in a `for` loop declaration is looked after, and if the `for` loop is less than 10 lines, the rule will allow a short name, but if the loop is more than 10 lines, it will raise a violation. 

[http://www.objectmentor.com/omTeam/martin_r.html Robert C. Martin] says in his [http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882 Clean Code] book that if the for loop is 5 lines long, a short variable is acceptable, but I felt 10 was better, specially since 3 of those lines are the for the declaration and the opening and closing squidlies....

Sight, I assumed way too much. I was under the impression that, when I was using the `method.Variables` that would return me all the variables ever declared under the specified method. Boy was I wrong. So, I ended up adding more code inside the Resources directory and adjusted the add-in code accordingly. Now, it catches a lot more stuff that it was before. Assumption is the mother of all screw ups. And I screwed up. :D


*August 8th, 2012*

Enhancement to the trailing spaces rule. I have added a list of characters that can be followed by a space. This is a must when splitting code lines on multiple lines. Modified the too many comments rule to exclude `// TODO`, `// HACK` and `// UNDONE` comments.
